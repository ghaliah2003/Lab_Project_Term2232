\`a. What does the above code chunk do?

\`b. Plot the counts of the pet names (animal_name) in top_10_names

\`10. (2 points)

\`The below code plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus
the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat and
dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the x = y
line; if a name appeared on this line, the name’s popularity would be
exactly the same for dogs and cats.
